## How to Build

My development environment is based on Linux and Mac so I don't know if it will work on Windows. I'm afraid probably not for the time been.

So first of all you have to have Godot successfully built in your system. That's out of scope of this simple how to.

Now, assuming you can git clone from GitHub, just clone LuaScript into Godo's source code 'modules' folder and then, build Godot again adding to the command line the following options

module_luascript_enabled=yes

If everything has gone well, you'll have a running Godot with Lua support!

For now not much is done but the simple fact of having Godot built with this initial code is already a cool thing!

So keep watching the development as I'm slowlly but steadly adding more features.

Have fun!
